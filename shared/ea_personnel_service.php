 * Single source of truth for reading Faculty / Staff / Executive
 * Assistant / Student data, per Dean Module refactor Step 17. Used by
 * dean_dashboard.php and dean_evaluation.php (and anywhere else in the
 * Dean module that needs a roster) so there is exactly one query per
 * role, not one per page.
 *
 * There is no separate "Personnel Registry" table — confirmed against
 * admin/manage_privileged_accounts.php: Executive Assistant, Faculty
 * (role='teacher'), Staff, Student, Principal, and Dean accounts all
 * live in the single `users` table, gated by role + account_status
 * ('pending'/'approved'/'blocked') + is_active. College scoping for
 * Faculty/Staff comes from the `user_year_levels` junction table.
 *
 * Confirmed decisions (do not re-derive):
 *   - Student college status uses `education_level = 'college'`, NOT
 *     the `year_level` pattern-matching used elsewhere in
 *     manage_privileged_accounts.php for its own filter UI.
 *   - "Executive Assistant" is the designation of the current
 *     Super Admin account. It is NOT a separate users.role value; the
 *     database role remains 'superadmin'.
 *   - "Included/visible in evaluation" has no dedicated column yet;
 *     account_status='approved' AND is_active=1 stands in for it.
 *
 * Still open (do not guess further — surface to the user instead):
 *   - No "evaluation_status" / "last_evaluation_date" column exists for
 *     Faculty/Staff/EA. That's the DEAN's own evaluation of them
 *     (Step 10) — a different flow from the student->teacher
 *     evaluations the original dashboard tracked via evaluation_tracker
 *     (eval_type='student'). Every row defaults to 'not_started' until
 *     the eval_type/table for Dean-initiated evaluations is confirmed.
 *   - "Program" isn't a column on teacher/staff rows (only `course` on
 *     students) — left null pending confirmation of where Faculty
 *     program assignment lives.
